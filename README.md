ECU Tuning Application in Flask By Taylor Christian Newsome

This code is a starting point and may require adjustments to work with your specific ECU hardware and libraries. You’ll need to replace the placeholder password checks with proper hashing (e.g., using werkzeug.security) and integrate actual ECU communication logic using libraries like python-OBD.
The database is currently SQLite; you may want to switch to a more robust database like PostgreSQL or MySQL in production.
This structure should help you get started on your ECU tuning application. Feel free to expand upon this base with more advanced features like data visualization, error handling, and user profile management. If you have any specific features or functionalities in mind, let me know!
